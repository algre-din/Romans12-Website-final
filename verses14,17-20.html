    <h2 class="subheading">Verses 14, 17-20</h2>

    <div class="text_1">
        <p><strong>Loving the Difficult: A Call to Bless, Not Curse </strong>

            <br><br><span class="Romans v14">Romans 12:14<span class="Romanstext v14text"></span></span> opens with a tough challenge: “Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.” It’s easy to be kind to people who are kind to us, but what about those who wrong us? This verse isn’t saying we have to ignore the hurt or pretend everything is fine. Instead, it calls us to choose kindness in response to unkindness. It’s a radical love that reflects Jesus' heart. For a girl in her late teens or early twenties, this might play out in school, work, or even on social media—where criticism or conflict can easily spiral into bitterness. This verse is a gentle reminder to rise above the negativity and respond with grace.
            <br><br><strong>Living Peacefully in a Chaotic World </strong>
            <br><br>In <span class="Romans v17v18">verses 17-18<span class="Romanstext v17v18text"></span></span>, Paul writes, "Do not repay anyone evil for evil" and "If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone." It's so tempting to snap back when someone is rude or unfair, but here, God is calling us to something deeper. The focus is on doing our part to promote peace, even when others don’t. In a world where cancel culture and callouts are common, this verse asks us to take a step back and think: How can I bring peace into this situation? Sometimes, that might mean walking away from an argument, praying for the person who hurt you, or choosing to stay calm when emotions run high.
            <br><br><strong>Letting God Handle Justice</strong>
            <br><br><span class="Romans v19">Romans 12:19<span class="Romanstext v19text"></span></span> reminds us not to seek revenge but to leave justice to God. This is especially hard when we feel wronged. When we’re hurt, the desire for revenge can feel overwhelming, but this passage encourages us to trust that God will take care of things in His time and His way. It’s freeing to know that we don’t have to carry the burden of getting even. Instead, we can let it go and trust God with the outcome. 
            <br><br><strong>Overcoming Evil with Good </strong>
            <br><br>Finally, <span class="Romans v20">verse 20<span class="Romanstext v20text"></span></span> says, “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink.” This is a radical way of confronting evil. Rather than letting bitterness take root, Paul calls us to meet hostility with compassion. It's not about being a doormat, but about showing love in unexpected ways that can soften hearts—even our own. </p>

                <h3>"Jim Elliot - “He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose”</h3>

                <p>Elizabeth Elliot's response to the killing of her husband, Jim, by the Minkayani tribe is a profound example of the radical love described in Romans 12:14-20. Instead of harboring hatred or seeking revenge, she chose to live out the call to "bless those who persecute you." Despite the immense personal pain she endured, Elizabeth returned to the very people responsible for her husband's death and continued to minister to them. Her decision reflects the heart of Romans 12:17-18, where Paul urges believers to avoid repaying evil with evil and to pursue peace. By offering forgiveness and love, Elizabeth didn't allow bitterness to control her. She entrusted justice to God, fulfilling Romans 12:19, and, in an act of grace, demonstrated the power of overcoming evil with good, showing love to those who had wronged her in the most unimaginable way.</p>

                    <p class="description">Explore the powerful testimony of Jim and Elizabeth Elliot, a couple whose lives were fully devoted to Christ. Their story is a profound example of a man deeply rooted in God's love, who led his family with a reverent fear of the Lord. Elizabeth, in her sacrificial service, showed the strength and grace of a woman who set aside self to follow God, even through great suffering. Their daughter’s reflections on their love and faith reveal the beauty of a Christ-centered marriage, one that glorifies God and serves as an enduring inspiration for all who seek to live faithfully.
