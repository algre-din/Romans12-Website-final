    <h2 class="subheading">Verse 21</h2>

    <div class="text_1">
        <p><br><br><strong>Overcome Evil with Good </strong>
            
            <br><br>In <span class="Romans v21">Romans 12:21<span class="Romanstext v21text"></span></span>, Paul writes, “Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.” It’s a simple sentence, but it packs so much power and truth. In a world full of negativity, judgment, and sometimes downright cruelty, this verse reminds us of our call to shine as lights. It’s about living in a way that others can’t help but see something different in us—God’s love.
            
            <br><br><strong>Selflessness in Action</strong>
            
            <br><br>When Paul talks about overcoming evil with good, it’s more than just “being nice.” It’s about choosing to put others first, even when it’s hard. It’s showing kindness to the person who wronged you, or going out of your way to help someone, even when you’re tired or busy. Being selfless means we stop thinking about what we deserve or what we want, and instead focus on how we can be a blessing to others. It’s counter-cultural, but it’s exactly how we show the world who Jesus is. 
            
            <br><br><strong>Being a Light in Dark Places</strong>
            
            <br><br>Living out Romans 12:21 is all about becoming that light in dark places. It’s not always easy, but that’s where the power of God comes in. People are watching how we respond to challenges. Are we reflecting Christ, or are we just blending in with everyone else? When we choose to respond with love, grace, and selflessness, we become a beacon of hope, pointing people to God without even needing to say a word. 
            
            <br><br><strong>Letting God Work Through You</strong>
            
            <br><br>It’s easy to think that overcoming evil with good is about our own strength, but the truth is we need God’s help. He’s the one who transforms our hearts and gives us the ability to keep loving, keep forgiving, and keep shining. As you surrender your plans and desires to Him, He gives you a bigger purpose—one that isn’t focused on what you can get, but on what you can give. In doing that, you’ll find the ultimate fulfillment, knowing that you’re making a real impact on the world around you. 
            
            <br><br><strong>You Were Made to Shine</strong>
            
            <br><br>At the end of the day, Romans 12:21 is a call to live selflessly and be a light in this world. It’s not always easy, but it’s worth it. God created you with unique gifts and opportunities to shine His light. So, don’t shy away from the challenge—embrace it, and watch how God can use your life to spread His love everywhere you go.</p>

            <p>Bryce Crawford taking the gospel to places like the Satanic city is a powerful example of overcoming evil with good, as taught in Romans 12:21. By boldly sharing God’s love in spiritually dark places, Bryce is embodying Paul’s call to not be overcome by evil, but instead to conquer it with good. Just as this verse challenges us to shine as lights in a world filled with negativity and darkness, Bryce’s actions show selflessness in action. He’s choosing to bring hope and truth to places where it’s needed most, reflecting Christ’s love even when it's difficult. Through his boldness, he exemplifies being a light in dark places and letting God work through him to make an eternal impact.</p>

                <p class="description">I encourage you to take a moment to read Daisy Báez-Castillo's inspiring testimony about following God's call to mission work. Her story is a powerful reminder that when we've received the peace, love, and joy of living a life in the image of Christ, we're called to share it with others. We may not all be sent to distant nations, but as young women, we can spread the gospel by stepping out of our comfort zones and sharing the reason behind our joy. Daisy's journey shows how growing in love for God leads us to care deeply about what He loves—bringing His glory to the world. Read her testimony and be inspired by how she embraced the Great Commission to make His name known.

    <h2 class="subheading">Verses 1-2</h2>

    <div class="text_1"> 

        <p><span class="Romans v1v2">Romans 12:1-2<span class="Romanstext v1v2text"></span></span> is a powerful call to live fully for God. It challenges us to move beyond just attending church or saying we believe, and instead, let our entire lives reflect Him. This passage is about daily surrender, transformation, and service.
        <br><br><strong>Living Sacrifices in Everyday Life</strong>
        <br><br><span class="Romans v1">Romans 12:1<span class="Romanstext v1text"></span></span> says to "offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God." Paul is urging us to live fully for God in everything we do. It’s not about giving something up but about choosing to live in a way that honors God every day. Instead of thinking of sacrifice as something painful, it’s about living with purpose—trusting God's plan and being willing to serve Him in all areas of life. 
        <br><br>This is the foundation of Christian service. Our lives become an ongoing offering to God, reflecting Him in both small and big ways, whether it's through kindness, generosity, or just being present for others.
        <br><br><strong>Standing Out by Being Transformed</strong>
        <br><br><span class="Romans v2">Romans 12:2<span class="Romanstext v2text"></span></span> tells us, “Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.” This means we need to think differently from what culture tells us. The world often focuses on self-interest, but Paul calls us to let God shape our mindset, leading us to serve out of love, not obligation. 
        <br><br>When we allow God to transform our thinking, we start to see service as more than just a task—it’s about caring for others because we’re loved by God. Whether it’s helping a friend or showing kindness to a stranger, we begin to serve with genuine compassion.
        <br><br><strong>Discovering God's Purpose in Service</strong>
        <br><br><span class="Romans v2i">Romans 12:2<span class="Romanstext v2itext"></span></span> continues, “Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing, and perfect will.” As we draw closer to God, He helps us understand how to serve. It’s not always about big acts; sometimes, it’s in the everyday moments where we show God’s love—listening to a friend, standing up for someone, or simply being kind.
        <br><br>Ultimately, <span class="Romans v1v2i">Romans 12:1-2<span class="Romanstext v1v2itext"></span></span> calls us to live a life of service, not out of obligation, but as a joyful response to God’s love. When we offer ourselves to God and let Him transform us, we find purpose in serving others and making a real difference.</p>

            <p>Being saved is not the same as living in the image of Jesus Christ. Avary's baptism testimony is a powerful reminder that no matter how far we may have strayed from God, it's never too late to commit our lives to Him. Her transformation reflects <span class="Romans v1v2ii">Romans 12:1-2<span class="Romanstext v1v2iitext"></span></span>, where Paul calls believers to offer themselves as living sacrifices and be transformed by the renewing of their minds. Avary's life changed as she sought to reflect God and be ready to do His will. For young women, this also means being set apart from the world, embracing a life that may look different from society or the culture around them, and choosing to live fully for Christ.</p>
