    <h2 class="subheading">Verses 3-8</h2>

    <div class="text_1">
        <p><span class="Romans v3v8">Romans 12:3-8<span class="Romanstext v3v8text"></span></span> is a passage that challenges us to see ourselves clearly and to recognize that God has uniquely shaped each of us for a purpose. It's easy to fall into the trap of comparison—wondering why we don’t have the same talents or opportunities as someone else. But in these verses, Paul reminds us to be content and grateful for who we are and where God has placed us.
        <br><br><strong>Understanding Humility</strong>
        <br><br>Paul begins in <span class="Romans v3">verse 3<span class="Romanstext v3text"></span></span> by warning against pride. He says, "Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment." This doesn't mean we should downplay our gifts or pretend we’re less than we are. Instead, it's about having a balanced view—acknowledging that any talent, skill, or opportunity we have comes from God. When we recognize that everything we are is a gift from Him, it helps us to stay humble and grateful. 
        <br><br><strong>Every Gift Has a Purpose </strong>
        <br><br>In <span class="Romans v4v5">verses 4-5<span class="Romanstext v4v5text"></span></span>, Paul uses the metaphor of the body. Just like our physical body has different parts that serve different functions, the body of Christ (which includes all believers) is made up of people with different gifts. Some of us might be great at encouraging others, while others are amazing at serving or teaching. God has intentionally given us these differences, and no one part of the body is more important than another. This is a beautiful reminder to stop comparing ourselves to others! Whether your gift is public or behind the scenes, every role is crucial, and God values each one equally. 
        <br><br><strong>Using Your Gifts With Gratitude </strong>
        <br><br><span class="Romans v6v8">Verses 6-8<span class="Romanstext v6v8text"></span></span> talk about specific gifts, encouraging us to use them with the right attitude. If you’re gifted in leading, lead diligently. If your strength is mercy, be cheerful in it. Whatever your gift, use it fully without holding back, because God has given it to you for a reason.
        <br><br>The bottom line? God created you uniquely with specific gifts and a special place in His plan. Instead of wishing we had someone else’s talent or calling, we can trust that God knows best and has equipped us perfectly for where He wants us to serve. Be content and grateful for the gifts He’s given you and use them confidently, knowing you are contributing to something much bigger than yourself. </p>

            <p>In this snippet of a JWLKRS Worship podcast episode, Noelle's experience in coming together with other Christian creators in the music ministry taught her valuable lessons about humility and purpose. Initially feeling underqualified, she realized that her self-doubt distracted her from focusing on God and His plans. This aligns with <span class="Romans v3v8i">Romans 12:3-8<span class="Romanstext v3v8itext"></span></span>, where Paul encourages believers to view themselves with sober judgment and recognize that every talent comes from God. By fixating on her inadequacies, Noelle fell into comparison, forgetting that the body of Christ comprises different parts, each with unique functions <span class="Romans v4v5i">(v.4-5)<span class="Romanstext v4v5itext"></span></span>. Embracing her role allowed her to serve with gratitude and confidence, understanding that every contribution, no matter how small, is essential to God's purpose. This shift in perspective helped Noelle step back from herself and engage fully in the ministry, realizing it’s not about individual talent but about glorifying God and serving others. </p>

            <p class="description">Shame can be a powerful force that holds us back from stepping into the gifts God has given us. It makes us feel unworthy, defective, and beyond redemption. But in this testimony, a young woman shares how she was set free from the chains of shame. She once believed she was too far gone, but now she stands confidently, declaring that she is redeemed, loved, and valued by God. Her story reminds us that shame has no place in the life of a child of God, and encourages us to embrace our identity in Him and serve without fear. 
            <br>Be inspired by reading her full testimony, and let it remind you that no matter your past, God has a purpose for your life.
