                <h3>Avary Salagan</h3>   
                <p>Being saved is not the same as living in the image of Jesus Christ. Avary's baptism testimony is a powerful reminder that no matter how far we may have strayed from God, it's never too late to commit our lives to Him. Her transformation reflects <span class="Romans v1v2ii">Romans 12:1-2<span class="Romanstext v1v2iitext"></span></span>, where Paul calls believers to offer themselves as living sacrifices and be transformed by the renewing of their minds. Avary's life changed as she sought to reflect God and be ready to do His will. For young women, this also means being set apart from the world, embracing a life that may look different from society or the culture around them, and choosing to live fully for Christ.

                <p>“When I was bound by shame and haunted by the Gospel and the love of God, I always rejected Him because I was always asking, “Do you know who you’re dealing with? I’m defective. I’ve done too much. I am too far gone. Just let me live or let me die.” But now I’m free, and I live to face Psalm 139 every day. Because when I call shame out for who she is, the first thing I lead with is “Do you know who you’re dealing with? God knows my name. I am redeemed. I am free. I am loved. I am valued. I have worth. And I am defined by a good, good God. He is a force to be reckoned with. And I am a daughter of God. I am not to be trifled with.””

                <p>“"I’ve come to the realization that I’ll never be one of those women who has perfect place settings and matching china (believe me, I want to be like them).  I admire women who make an art of hosting others in their home.  One day I hope I will graduate to a different hospitality level, but until then my guests and I can continue to laugh about the fact that I can only find three spoons and some of my plastic cups leak.  The best part about hosting guests is breaking bread while having genuine conversations about the Lord.  It’s in those moments that bonds are created and friendships are forged.  Hospitality creates family."”

                <h3>Elizabeth Elliot through her daughter, Valerie Elliot Shepard</h3>   
                <p>Explore the powerful testimony of Jim and Elizabeth Elliot, a couple whose lives were fully devoted to Christ. Their story is a profound example of a man deeply rooted in God's love, who led his family with a reverent fear of the Lord. Elizabeth, in her sacrificial service, showed the strength and grace of a woman who set aside self to follow God, even through great suffering. Their daughter’s reflections on their love and faith reveal the beauty of a Christ-centered marriage, one that glorifies God and serves as an enduring inspiration for all who seek to live faithfully.

                <p>“"Before giving me a heart for the nations, God gave me a heart for himself. I discovered that the more I knew God, the more I grew in love for him. And by loving him, my life leaned towards what he loves. When we are called from death to life, we are also called to seek and think about the things above. If we have been adopted as children, our purpose is tied to our new identity. All that we are and do is about glorifying his name, until the day when every tongue confesses Jesus Christ as Lord, and the knowledge of the glory of God fills all the earth."”
